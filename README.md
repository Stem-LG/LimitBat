you can find compiled binaries in release section, and to run plz execute the sudo_limitbat file :)

to build from source,
install flutter,
clone the repo,
cd into the project,
run `flutter pub get`,
run `flutter build linux --release`,
and you'll find the binary in build/linux/x64/release/bundle/

Have fun :)
